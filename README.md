### Hi there 👋

😁 My name is [Robson Costa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robson-costa-68057055/) and i´m researcher and professor at [IFSC (Federal Instititute of Santa Catarina)](https://www.ifsc.edu.br) on south of Brazil.<br>
🏫 I´m also director of [AgroTechLab](https://agrotechlab.lages.ifsc.edu.br), a laboratory that develop IoT based technologies for agribusiness.<br>
🌐 In this context, i´m the initiator of TTN community in the Lages city ([TTN/Lages](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/community/lages/)).<br><br>

🌱 As this is my institutional GitHub account, all the repositories i work in are allocated at [AgroTechLab](https://github.com/AgroTechLab-IFSC).<br>
👯 Most repositories are public and follow open source or open hardware licenses.<br><br>

🏢 I also have a private account on GitHub ([here](https://github.com/robson-costa)) where there are private repositories of work i've done for some companies.
